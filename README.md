I am a software developer by trade but am a technologist by passion. I love reading books, hanging out with close friends and family, and spending time outdoors. Working in technology has made me appreciate those days where I am disconnected completely.

- 🔭 &nbsp;I specialise in migrating legacy products to the cloud while revamping them with cloud-native technologies.
- 🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently learning [Dapr](https://dapr.io).
- 💬 &nbsp;Read my blog posts at [Medium.com](https://headleysj.medium.com).
